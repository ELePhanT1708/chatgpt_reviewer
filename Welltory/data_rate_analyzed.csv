alexandermarshall@example.net;As someone who has struggled with anxiety and stress for years, I've found Welltory to be incredibly helpful. The app's stress tracking and HRV analysis have helped me better understand my body's response to stress, and the guided meditations and breathing exercises have been a lifesaver when I'm feeling overwhelmed.;03.01.2023;10;8
jeffreyvincent@example.org;I've been using Welltory for a few months now, and I love it. The app is easy to use and provides me with a ton of valuable information about my health. The stress tracking feature is particularly helpful for me, as I tend to get stressed easily. The guided meditations and breathing exercises are also great for managing stress.;03.02.2023;9;10

lgreen@example.net;Welltory is a decent app overall. I appreciate the stress tracking and HRV analysis, but I do wish there were more personalized recommendations based on my data. The guided meditations and breathing exercises are helpful, but I wish there were more of them.;01.02.2023;7;7
ryanryan@example.com;I like using Welltory to track my stress levels and HRV, but I find the app a bit clunky and difficult to navigate at times. It can also be a bit overwhelming with all the data and graphs. I think the app could benefit from a simpler, more streamlined design.;02.01.2023;6;6
williamwang@example.org;I've been using Welltory for a few weeks now, and while I like the stress tracking and HRV analysis, I find the app's recommendations to be a bit generic.

kevin03@example.com;Welltory is okay, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. The free version of the app is quite limited, and the paid version doesn't offer much more in terms of features. I do appreciate the stress tracking and HRV analysis, but I'm not sure it's worth the monthly subscription fee.;12.01.2023;5;3
robertbautista@example.net;Welltory is a decent app, but I find the HRV measurements to be a bit finicky. I often have trouble getting a good reading, and the app can be a bit frustrating to use as a result. The stress tracking and guided meditations are helpful, though.;20.01.2023;4;6
